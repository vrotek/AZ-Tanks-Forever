# AZ-Tanks-Forever
Repository for all builds of the fan game AZ Tanks forever


## Why does this exist?
AZ Tanks was a neat little flash game about 2 Tanks fighting one another, now since the flashplayer no longer exists I wanted to recreate it using Unity. It's not really a remake more like a reimagening, since I've now decided that i'm gonna add some feature that didn't exist in the original and give it a bit of an arcade look by using pixel art. However when I'm done with all the networking I'll implement the original look and gameplay of AZ Tanks so that you can change it back to the original in the options menu if you want to.

### Whats the current build?
This repo is split up into different branches FP (first playable),Alpha, Beta, GM (Gold master), the branches will be created when I get to those versions. If you check out one of the branches you will see the different build folders if you download them you find the exe file within. I may change it so that the most current build is on master in the future.

## Will this be maintained?
This repo will get occasional updated builds until I get to releasing a GM version. Afterwards It will no longer be maintained.
