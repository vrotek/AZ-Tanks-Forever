# AZ-Tanks-Forever
Repository for all builds of the fan game AZ Tanks forever


## Why does this exist?
AZ Tanks was a neat little flash game about 2 Tanks fighting one another, now since the flashplayer no longer exists I wanted to recreate it using Unity. It's not really a remake more like a reimagening, since I've now decided that i'm gonna add some feature that didn't exist in the original and give it a bit of an arcade look by using pixel art. However when I'm done with all the networking I'll implement the original look and gameplay of AZ Tanks so that you can change it back to the original in the options menu if you want to.

## Will this be maintained?
This repo will get occasional updated builds until I get to releasing a GM version. Afterwards It will no longer be maintained.
